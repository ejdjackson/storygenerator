        <h1>Spooky Tesco Trip</h1>
        <p id="story">
            On a chilly Halloween night, Conor, Owen, and Arron decided to visit Tesco for snacks. As they approached, they noticed the shop was <button class="story-button" onclick="generateWord(this, 'adjective')">[adjective]</button> and covered in eerie decorations. 

            "Do you think Tesco is haunted?" asked Conor, <button class="story-button" onclick="generateWord(this, 'verb-ing')">[verb-ing]</button> nervously. They stepped inside, where a cold breeze seemed to <button class="story-button" onclick="generateWord(this, 'verb')">[verb]</button> through the aisles. Suddenly, they spotted a floating <button class="story-button" onclick="generateWord(this, 'noun')">[noun]</button> in the drinks aisle! "Must be the ghost of a thirsty shopper," Owen joked, though he was clearly <button class="story-button" onclick="generateWord(this, 'adjective')">[adjective]</button>.

            When they got to the food aisle, the shelves were stocked with all sorts of <button class="story-button" onclick="generateWord(this, 'adjective')">[adjective]</button> treats. "What should we have for lunch?" Arron pondered, <button class="story-button" onclick="generateWord(this, 'verb-ing')">[verb-ing]</button> as he examined a pack of <button class="story-button" onclick="generateWord(this, 'noun')">[noun]</button>s that seemed to glow. 

            The drinks were next, but every bottle looked a bit... strange. "Should we try the <button class="story-button" onclick="generateWord(this, 'noun')">[noun]</button>-flavoured soda or the one thatâ€™s <button class="story-button" onclick="generateWord(this, 'adjective')">[adjective]</button>?" Owen wondered aloud, grimacing.

            Finally, they reached the sweets section, and it was the hardest decision of all. "There are too many options!" Conor said, <button class="story-button" onclick="generateWord(this, 'verb-ing')">[verb-ing]</button> as he picked up a bag of <button class="story-button" onclick="generateWord(this, 'noun')">[noun]</button>-shaped gummies that were practically glowing. 

            Before leaving, they passed a display of hats and dared each other to try one on. Conor picked up a <button class="story-button" onclick="generateWord(this, 'adjective')">[adjective]</button> hat, placed it on his head, and immediately felt like a <button class="story-button" onclick="generateWord(this, 'noun')">[noun]</button>. The others burst out laughing and tried on hats too, feeling both <button class="story-button" onclick="generateWord(this, 'adjective')">[adjective]</button> and completely ridiculous.

            With their bags full of strange snacks and a story to tell, they left the haunted Tesco, each secretly wondering if they'd dare to come back next Halloween.
